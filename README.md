# Hi there, I'm Mattia Ballardini! 👋

## 👩‍💻 About Me
I'm graduated in Mathematical Engineering with a specialization in Statistical Learning.

## 📘 Master Thesis
[Role networks analysis via fuzzy clustering](https://github.com/balla1/Role-classification-in-networks)
Explored role classification in complex networks using fuzzy clustering and custom feature selection. Applied the model to global trade and social media datasets, uncovering dynamic role evolution and hidden structures.

## 🔬 Other Projects
- [Informed Proposal Sampling Strategy](https://github.com/balla1/Informed-proposal-sampling-strategy)
Bayesian nonparametric change points detection for multivariate time series with missing observations implemented in R.
- [Predicting-Bank-Customers-Attrition](https://github.com/balla1/Predicting-Bank-Customers-Attrition): 
Develop a classification model that accurately predicts customer attrition using data analysis with Python.
